    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There's talk in the reviews about whether it's okay to eat dairy in the paleo diet. Ripstel says, "Some people opt for a little dairy on a paleo diet, especially butter. I think it is more of a grey area than a hard rule." Nichola added: "Not paleo, but can be considered 'primal' because of the dairy." So choose cheese if you like or simply skip it; either way, you'll love this quick paleo lunch.</p>
